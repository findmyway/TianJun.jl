## About the Avatar

The original photo was taken in the summer of 2012 by my current wife. It was in a small garden in front of the library in the south campus of [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/) . I've forgoten which book I was reading, but I still remember that pen, a blue mechanical pencil.
